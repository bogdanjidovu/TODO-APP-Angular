# TODO App - Angular

A "To Do" application used to store daily todo lists, grocery lists or ideas. This app was built in order to learn Angular basics and to compare 2 apps with same usage but developed in different frontend frameworks (Angular vs React), because I also built a "To Do" app in React.
